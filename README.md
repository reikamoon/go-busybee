# busybee [go!] :bee:

## About :bee:
A to-do-list app created in Go and React, with MongoDB as a database. A remake of one of my older projects, busybee:bee:, which was made in 2020 and developed with flask, mongodb, and jinja.
I followed [this tutorial](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/build-a-todo-app-in-golang-mongodb-and-react-e1357b4690a6) to help me get started.

## How to Get Started :bulb:
:one: <b>Clone the Repo:</b>
`git clone https://github.com/reikamoon/go-busybee.git`

:two: <b> From the go-server directory, run:</b>
`go run main.go`

:three:<b> From the client directory, run:</b>
`npm install` to install dependencies, and then:
`npm start` or `yarn start`

## What is busybee [go!]? :thinking:
Simple to-do-list app that allows users to create tasks, mark them as complete, and delete as needed.
